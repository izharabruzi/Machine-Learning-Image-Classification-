# Machine-Learning-Image-Classification
# Final Project from Dicoding Class Academy "Machine Learning untuk Pemula"
# Rating 4 out of 5

## Project Description
Basically, the project was to **measure understanding of Neural Network (NN)** using TensorFlow from **student** who gets into this class. The project itself to makes a model **classification** from **3 category of images** with the purpose of **prediction the images**.

## Criteria
### 1. The dataset should be divided into train and validation set with portion of 40% dataset.
### 2. Augmentation needed for this case
### 3. Using image data generator and sequential model.
### 4. Minimum accuracy 85%

## Dataset Description
**The dataset is provided from Dicoding with images format**. Basically, the images inspired from traditional china games. **The images** itself were taken on **three category** of **hand-drawing which is rock, paper, scissors (batu, kertas, gunting)**. This is the example of dataset:

## Method
First of all, The **augmentation** images were implementing from **ImageDataGenerator keras library**. Then for model itself using **sequential model** from keras with **configuration its layer** to get **high accuracy and minimum time to predict rock, paper, scissors (batu, kertas, gunting)**.

### Details of rating
#### Rating 1: All conditions are met, but there are indications of plagiarism.
#### Rating 2: All the provisions are set, but the writing of the code still needs to be improved.
#### Rating 3: All conditions are met but only follow what is in the module.
#### Rating 4: All conditions are met and the accuracy of the program is above 95%.
#### Rating 5: All conditions are met, accuracy is above 96%, and using three or more techniques that are not taught in the module such as the use of Callbacks.
